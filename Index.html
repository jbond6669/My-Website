            <!--Look for quote to add either here, in-between the <p>'s or after<p>-->

            <p>This guide is guaranteed to help you survive the wastelands of what used to be known as Boston,
                Massachusetts!</p><br>

            <h2><a href="Beast.html">Beastiary</a></h2><br>

            <p>The wastelands are both dangerous and exciting, but beware of the creatures that live and thrive in this
                atomic wasteland. Many of these beasts are vicous and will not hesitate to attack. A list of
                descriptions
                and images to help you identify these beasts. Refer to the Beastiary</p><br>
            <p>I needed more material to make it so that i have scroll bar up and down so that i can make a return to
                top button. Hopefully I can add enough text, just to deete it later to make this more presentble, so
                that it scrolls to the bottom for this test even thoug i know it will work. Now i have concluded that it
                works but i need to keep this here for now for this assignment!!</p>

            <!--Possibly seperate into Melee weapons and Ranged. Will need img and descriptions-->

            <h2><a href="Weapons.html">Weapons</a></h2><br>

            <p>While making your way through the wastelands you must always protect yourself! In the weapons page you
                can
                view and see descriptions of all different types of weapons. You want to be up close and personal when
                "defending" your self from another survivor or beast, theres a weapon for you! Would you rather take out
                the
                threat from a distance without them even knowing you are ther, you guessed it, there is a weapon for
                you.
                Just follow the link to browse and find the weapon thats right for you!</p><br>
            <!--May seperate into "Good & Evil"; Need to find img and add description-->

            <h2><a href="Faction.html">Factions</a></h2><br>

            <p>When exploring the wastelands do not forget that you are not alone! There are other survivors just like
                yourself out there. Whether you just want to lend a helping hand to you fellow survivors or if you just
                want
                to take everything by force, there is a faction for you. Visit the factions page to learn more about the
                factions all over that can help you survive, or don't it's all up to you!</p><br>
