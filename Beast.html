        <p>Welcome to the beastiary. This will help you identify the different types of creatures that you may encounter
            on your travels throughout the wasteland. With the knowledge gained here you may just live a little longer!

        <h2>Creatures</h2>
        <p>Animals of all kinds were affected by the radiation of the bombs that were dropped. Things like scorpians,
            rats and even some sea life have mutated into some horrid creatures. These mutated creatures are even
            deadlier than before due to the changes.</p>
        <h2>Humanoids</h2>
        <p>Some humans that were exposed to insane amounts of radiation have become mutated to the point that they
            barely resemble their old selves. Super mutants and ghouls were once human but the radiation from the bombs
            have mutated them to the point of madness and has give them a grotesque appearances.</p>
