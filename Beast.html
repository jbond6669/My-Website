        This text is just for the purpose of making columns and testing for my secondary pages! Now i am just typing just to type stuff and take up more page so that i can see the changes and how the columns work so that i can get better at this. this is going on for longer than i wanted but i need more text and i have to get this turned in. this is fun. maybe this is enough? maybe not now i am just seeing how fast i can type and how long before it bores me!@!!!!!
