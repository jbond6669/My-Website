                <li>Minute Men</li><br>
                <img src="images/minutemen" alt="minutemen-flag">
                <p>If you want to lend a hand to your neighbors then the Minute Men is for you! They are always looking
                    for like minded survivors to help make the wasteland a better place.</p><br>
                <p>The Minute Men are the all around good guys of the Commonwealth. They seek aid other settlers and
                    build a strong sense of community in the wasteland. They believe that if we all just work together
                    we can rebuild and make the wastelands more habitable. The Minute Men currently have two main bases
                    of operations. The first being a place called Sanctuary, this is located in the NorthWestern part of
                    the Commonwealth near Vault 111. The other is an old fort the Minute Men reclaimed from some
                    creatures. The fort is known as "The Castle" and is located due East of Diamond City, The Jewel of
                    the Commonwealth. Current leader is Preston Garvey.</p><br>
                <li>Brotherhood of Steel</li><br>
                <img src="images/BoS" alt="Brotherhood-of-steel">
                <p>If being a part of a technological-focused religous cult, I mean military, then the Brotherhood of
                    Steel is for you.</p><br>
                <p>The Brotherhood of Steel is another of the good guys of the Commonwealth. Although they are a "good"
                    faction so to speak, they do have a tendancy to go overboard with some of the citizens. The goal of
                    The Brotherhood is to help rebuild society. They are known to be a technological-focused military
                    faction. They are one of the only factions to have bases all over the United States but the current
                    base of operation for the Commonwealth is a their airship call the Prydwen. The current leader is
                    Elder Maxson.</p><br>
                <li>Railroad</li><br>
                <img src="images/railroad" alt="railroad">
                <p>Do you want to save Synthetic humans or even toasters? This secretive faction does just that. No on
                    officially knows their whereabouts but they have been known to show themselves to trustworthy
                    people.</p><br>
                <p>The Railroad is a group of humans who wish to save Synths from from being "killed". They are just
                    robots...right? I mean why save those machines, what's next toasters or Tv's? They try their best to
                    help so I included them in the good guys side. They do tend to butt heads with the Brotherhood of
                    Steel due to the technology they may or may not have. Current leader is someone known as Desdemona.

                    <img src="images/raider" alt="raider-flag">
                    <p>If you want to cause chaos and take whatever you want when you want, then find your local bandit
                        camp and join. If you don't want to be robber or even killed then I suggest you avoid these
                        people.</p><br>
                    <p>Bandits are just settlers who just want to be free to drink, do chems and take what they want
                        from who they want. There are sub factions of bandits but in the end they are all the same, some
                        just have better technology, weapons and armor. They can be found all over the Commonwealth. To
                        the average survivor these are dangerous people and should be avoided unless well equiped to
                        deal with such threats.</p><br>
                    <li>Gunners</li><br>
                    <img src="images/gunner" alt="gunner-flag">
                    <p>The Gunners are a mercanary faction. If the life of a mercanary and killing for caps is for you
                        then these guys are for you.</p><br>
                    <p>These guys have a no prisoner policy, so it is best not agitate them. They are basically just
                        better equiped and organized bandits. Them being organized and better equiped make them much
                        more dangerous than bandits and should not be engaged unless neccessary.</p><br>
                    <li>Institute</li><br>
                    <img src="images/institute" alt="institute-seal">
                    <p>The boogeyman of the Commonwealth!</p><br>
                    <p>Not much information is known about the Institute. There have been reports of the Instatute
                        abducting people and replacing them with Synthetic humans, also known as Synths. Some believe
                        they are just a conspiracy and are used as a scare tactics, even if there is evidence of those
                        who have been abducted and replaced. Any further information on this group is much appreciated.
