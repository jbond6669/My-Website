        <h2>Guns</h2><br>
        <p>Don't want to be in close proximity to your victim? Then a gun is for you! With one of these found around the
            wasteland or puchased at a vendor, you can walk with tall and with confidence!</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Pipe Guns</li><br>
            <p>Pipe guns are cheap and not all that powerful or reliable, but it is better than walking around empty
                handed out there. These guns have one good point of sale and that is that they are the most customizable
                guns in the wasteland. </p><br>
            <li>10mm Pistol</li><br>
            <p>The 10mm is affordable and is a reliable side arm for any wastelander. They can be customized to be
                automatic if that is what you are into. They do moderate damage and are common throughout the
                Commonwealth.</p><br>
            <li>Energy Guns</li><br>
            <p>Energy guns like the laser pistol or rifle are a more technologically advaced weapons. These use fusion
                cells instead of the traditional ballistic ammo.
                these guns are better at killing heavily armored people, robots and some creaturs. Where a ballistic
                round may bounce off, the energy from these guns will not!</p><br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="melee">
        <h2>Melee</h2><br>
        <p>If you want to be upclose and personal when "defending" yourself in the wasteland, then pick up a melee
            weapon and bash in some heads or stab, it's all up to you!</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Baseball Bat</li><br>
            <p>Baseball bats. These are cheap to make and easy to use, even a child couldn't mess up using one of these.
                One good swing to the head for some blunt trauma to your victim, I mean "attacker" and it is all over.
                These can be acquired by either making one, I mean it's just wood with some sort of core right, or
                buying one in Diamond City. If you have the know how then you can even custimize it for more damage.
                Want to make the victim bleed? Then add some barbed wire. Want them to burn as you beat them? Add a
                heating coil to it.</p><br>

            <li>Sledge Hammer</li><br>
            <p>This tool is great for breaking up rocks and also smashing in heads! If a normal Sledge Hammer is not
                what you want, then upgrade it to a Super Sledge by adding mini rocket to it to propel this weapon while
                swinging it for extra damage. These weapons do seem to be popular with the Super Mutants around the
                Commonwealth.</p><br>

            <li>Bladed Weapons</li><br>
            <p>With the use of a good knife or sword you can make your enemies bleed! These are common weapons found in
                any household. These can be customized but not as much as other weapons. These, like many others, are
                simple and straight to the point, get it "point?" So with these weapons just stick them with the pointy
                end and twist or just slash, whatever works for you.
                bleed even more.</p><br>

            <li>Fist Weapons</li><br>
            <p>Don't want to spend money on a weaon? If you are a strong wastelander then just punch stuff! No money is
                needed to just people and creatures of the wasteland. If you want to make your punches stronger then
                make use of brass knuckles. If you are strong and brave enough to kill a Death Claw then their claws can
                used to made into a devastating fist weapon </p><br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="legend">
        <h2>Legendary Weapons</h2><br>
        <p>These weapons are special and one of kind! If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of these then
            nothing will stand in your way and no one will even think twice about crossing you.</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Alien Blaster</li><br>
            <p>The Alien Blaster is just as the name suggests, it's a gun that was once used by an alien that happened
                to crash land here. It uses special ammo and is similar to laser weapons. Maybe if someone with great
                scientific knowledge gets this they can upgrade or change the ammo type and make better use of it due to
                it having limited uses becasuse of the alien ammo.</p><br>
            <li>Silver Machine Gun</li><br>
            <p>The machine gun is special because it one belonged to the famed vigilante the Silver Shroud. Only one
                exists today and is a novelty for those who are fans of the old radio show. This one in particular has
                been modified to be used as a real gun and not some toy!</p><br>
            <li>Grognak's Axe</li><br>
            <p>This axe is used by Grognak in the comics. It is a two handed axe that ment for cleaving things in 2.
                Only 1 is known to exist in the Commonwealth.</p><br>
            <li>2076 World Series Bat</li><br>
            <p>This bat is from 2076 World Series. This bat may look like a normal bat but it is anything but that. This
                bat will send any baseball, or someones head, flying over the horizon. So if you want to own a part of
                history that make slaying a pack of ghouls into a homerun derby then keep an eye out for this!</p><br>
